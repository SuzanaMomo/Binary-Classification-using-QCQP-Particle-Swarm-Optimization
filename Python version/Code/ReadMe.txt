1) binary_classification.py -for the second experiment, illustrates the binary classification of two classes
for both Algo A and B.
2) Algorithms - Implementation of Algorithm A and Algorithm B. 
3) Runtime_Comparison_plots- Generates the runtime comparison plots for both algorithms
for input growing from 10 to 1000 for simulated data and varying number of 
inputs for real datasets. The time arrays used here were recorded by
running 'Runtime_experiment_with_growing_inputs'.
4) Runtime_experiment_with_growing_inputs- experiment for recording the running times 
as the input grows for simulated datsets and for real datasets for both algorithms.
5) generate_data-generating data from .csv files of the real datasets.
6) scaled_data-preprocessing steps done the real datasets for scaling the data.
The .csv files of the real datasets are also included.
